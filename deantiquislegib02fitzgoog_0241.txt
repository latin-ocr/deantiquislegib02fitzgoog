P. clxxxvi—Note. The mention in this grant ot John Lord Bardolt to
the priory of Shouldbam, of Margaret, widow of Guy de Montfort, ot
Beaudesert, com. Warwielr, daughter of Thomas Beauehamp, Earl of War-
wich, and of Cathan'ne, daughter of Guy de Warwiolr, eldest son ot the
Earl of Warwtcb deceasah aeth April, 25 Edw. 111. 1351, together with
his own sister, Elisabeth, is of itself indicative of onear degree of lindred
between the parties ς and henos it may be assumed, aa an unquestiouable
fact, that Agnes, his mother, wife of Thomas Lord Bardolt', was the seventb
daughter of Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwiclr, and thet Margaret was
the aunt and Catburine the cousin-german of the grantor. According to
the pedigree of this family, compiled by John Rous, this earl had adaughter,
Agnes, who is described to bave been the wite ot. . . . . Cokesey, andafter·
warde of ..... Burdolf. Dugdale informs us that bo bad nine daughters,
whose portraitures were euriously drawn, and phaed in tho windows on the
south side of the quire of the collegiata ohureh in Warwiclr, and in the
habit of that time. Seven of them were married, and had their paternal
anns upon their inner garments, and on their enter mantle their husbaud's
arms. The same writer has also given an engraving of these nino daughters
so painted, and to each is a label with their names. Thus the ons labelled
Margareta has on ber gown‚ “ Gules, onrsillp and a fess or,’' the arms ot'
Beauchamp,and on hermantle, “ Bendy or an aaure,” the arms of Montlort;
and the serenth daughter, labelled Agneta, has the same arms on her gown,
and on her mautle, “ Azure, semea ot' cinquefoils or,’' the arms of Bardolf.
The crosa-crosslets are not limited to six, but spread all over the gorens, and
mantle also in respect of Juliana, the uinth daughter, who died unmarried. In
like manner the cinquefoils are not bmited to three, as usually barneby the
family of Bardolf. Elisabeth, another daughter, is twice pourtrayed as Isa-
hella and Elisabetb,andheving in each instance on her maalle, ‘⁶ Sablaa crosa
engrailed or,” the arms of Ullord, Earl of Sullolk, which repetition Dugdale
explains as being descriptiva of her first marriage with John Lord Strange
of Elaclrmera eom. Salop. Hence we may infer that Agnes was the wife,
first, of Thomas Lord Bardolf, whose eldest son John was born 18tb Jan.
lala; and that after his decease, on the 15th day of Feb. aEdw. Ill.
lare, she remam-led Sir Walter de Cokesey, of Cokesey, oom.Worc. whose
son and heir, sir Walter Cohesey‚ was executor of Sir William Trussell‚ ot'
Cublestou, corn. staff. whose will bears dote 10 Feb. 1379.
