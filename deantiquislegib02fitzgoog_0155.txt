nineteen and more, end the aforesaid Joan, eged eighteen and more, were his
daughters and nest heirs; salue of the manor nott, and no other lands held
by him in that county. Another inquisition was taken et Uckfield‚ on
Saturday nent after the feast of All Seium, 10 Hen. lv. ard Now, before

Robert Oxenbrugge, King’s escheator in Sussex, on which the several
munros of the menore of Barcomb end Plumpton are deduoed in like
manner, setting forth the fines and charters under which they were
respectively held by the deceased, and the names and agee of the heire as
above, which manors were held of Thomas Earl of Arundel, as of the
barony of Leues, by military service, both being worth forty marks
yearly. A third was taken at Oxford, on the let Oct, 10 Henry IV.
before Robert dames, the escheator of that county, as to the manor of
licitos, which was acquired under the grem of King Edward ΙΙ., and
which had been held by the deceased of the Prince of Wales, aa of the
honour of St. valery, by the service of a rent of one penny yearly, and
worth ten pounds. The inquisition as to the manor of Helloughton‚ com.
Leic.‚ was tehen on Thursday next before the feast of St. Michael‚ arth
sept„ 9 Hen. lv. before Alvered Trussell‚ the King's escheator, on which
we have this finding: “dicunt super sacramentum suum quod Dominus
Henricus, nuper Rex Anglie, Dux Normannie et Aquitanis et Comes
Andegavie, per litteras suas patentes juratoribus predictis ostensas dedit
manerium de Halloughton cum pertinentiis cuidam 'lhome Bardolf et here·
dibus suis, qui exirent de corpore filie Radulfi Henselyn, que quidem filia
nominabatur Rosa, per nomen tocius terre que fnit de hereditate Radulti
Hanselyn‚ avi predicte filie, videlieet, illam terram, que fuit escaeta prefati
nuper Regis et sibi remansit donanda per judicium curie sue.'’ From
these parties, who held tbis manor by virtue of this gift, the pedigree is
deduced as in the former inquisitione, and its velue put down at fifteen
marks. In like manner, upon the inquisition taken at Shelford on Monday
next after the feast of tbe Exultation of the Holy Cross, l7th Sept. 1408,
before Robert Twyford, escheator of the county of Nottingham, King
Henry the Second is stated to have given the manors of Shelford and
Stolrebardolf to the same ancestor of the deceased, and from him the

stands printed in the lpodigma Neustrioe of Welsinghem‚ which error baa bean blindly
followed by every modern writer, end doubtless arose from a mieconeeption that the
Arabio number 11 was the Roman numeral 11.
