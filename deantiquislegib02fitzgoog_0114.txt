cedain tosta, landa, meadows‚ prestares, woods‚ aad rents in Cranburn sor
the term of her life only, of which the reversion was belonging to Elisa·
beth, daughter and heir ol Roger Dammory, whom John Barduli had
already talen to wile, as of the inheritance ol* the me lloger her lether,
and that she died on Weduesday next aster the feast of All Saints last pub

Lecuellus, Earl of Uiator, had already taken to wife, was ectasin and next

Dugdale in his Baronage under bardolf, vol. i. p. 682, has totally mis·
understood the purport of this inquisition iu the following paragraph, in
which he cites the annals of the Ahbey ol Langley among the collectione of
Robert Glover‚ somerset Heraia, in proof that Thomas Lord Bardoll',
father of John, was buried in Shelford Priory, com. Notts, and the Close
Roll, 9th Edw. 111. m. 30, in procl thet John Barduli was then of age, and
had livery of his lands, in which year he marched into Sootland on the
King's service, and the Close Roll, lOth Edw. 111. m. 15, iu proof that he
then wedded Elisabeth, daughter and heir of Sir Roger Damory‚ by that
graecolonon, Elisabeth de Burgh, his wife, by whom at length he hade sair
iuheritance, vis. the mauors ol Craneburn, Terent Gundeville, Pymperne‚
and Wyke, with the boroughs of Wareham and Wayrnouth iu Dorsetshire.
ln procl of this last assertiou he cites the above inquisition and Close Roll
aoth Ed. 111. m. tl, erroneously, as the only portion ol this inheritance,
which descended to Elisabeth Bardolf‚ her daughter, was such property, as
had been acquired by purchase in the manor os Cranburn during her mar-
riage with Roger Lord Dammory, as noted in the extract given above.
