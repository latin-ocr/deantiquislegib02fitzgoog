her docem to Thomas Bardolf and his hcirs for ever, which manor was
then held of Lawrcnco dc Hnntyngficld, 1] what service was unknown, and

be lorty years and more, he being in fact in his salty-first year.

‘lhe jurors on the inquisition taken at Croydon, corn. Surrey, on the last
day of August, l⁷th Edw. 11, found that she had held tho manor of
Adyngton, in the aforesaid county, for the term of her life only, by the
service of making a certain dish called Maspigernoun at the coronation ol
the lord the lllng, and that astar the deoease of the said Isabella it was to
romain to Thomas Bardolf and his heirs, by fine thereos levied in the court
of the said lord tho King 1] charter of licence between the said Isabella
Lady Bardolf and Mastcr James de Mohun‚ to hold of tbe lord the King
and his heirs hythe service aforesaid. It is evident from the age of Thomas
Lord Bardolf, severally stated on these inquisitions as ol thirty years and
more, of forty years and more, and 1111] years and more, that her successor
in these manors was ber only surviving son and heir Thomas Lord
Bardclf, and that owing to the decease ot William Bardoll' her second son
without issue, such mauors as bad been settled upon him by the feofment of
King Edward 1, reverted in fae to the Lndy Isabella Bardoll‘, whereupcn 1]
fine, 10 which this Master Jamcs de Mohun‚ probably tha son of her mother
1] her first husband, John de Mohun‚ was a party, they were resettlcd upon
her oldest son, who by the jurors ol the inquisition taken at Lewes is
described in tbcse words, et dicunt quod predictus Thomas est filius et pro-
pinquior heres predicte Isabclle de sanguine, et est etatis triginta annorum
ct amplius. On inquisitions of later date, after the sailura of the male issue
of Isabclla Lady Bardoll', the charter of Edward 1. above recited was pro·
duced belom the jurum, who supposing that the entail had taken effect, they
falsely describe this elder brother, Thomas Bardolf, 10 have died without
issue, and that William Bardolr, his brother, left a son of the name of
Thomas Bardolf, who was the common ancestor, at variance with the find·
ings upon these contemporary inquisitions, taken immediately after the
(lacesse of the Lsdy Isabella Bardolf.

Thomas Lord Bardolf married a lady of the name cf Agnes, whose
lineage remmns unknown, and the assertion of the continuator of ΜΓ.
Blomfield's Essay towards aTopogrsphical History ol tho County of

Norfolk, that sbe was the daughter of the Lord Grandisson‚ is contradictcd
