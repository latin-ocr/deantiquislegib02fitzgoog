Thomas lord Bardolf made proof of bia age in the latu year of
Richard 11. 1390, and having done homage had livery of the portion of bis
inberitance not assigned in dower te his mother. On the accession of

Edward the Second to Roger Dammory, which is inserted by way of Inspexi·
' mus on the Patent Roll of the first year of his reign, part 7, m. 211, with

aioncm predictam ratam habentes et gratam eam pro nobis et heredibus
nostris, quantum in uobis est, acceptamus, approbamus, ratificamus, ac
dilecto et fideli nostro Thema ds Bardolf, consanguineoet heredi predicti
Rogeri, et heredibus de corpore ipsius Thome exeuntibus, imperpetuum confir·
mamus, prout littere predicte rationabiliter natantum ita tamen quod si pre·
fato Rogero vel heredibus suis per ipsum proavum nostrum vel heredes vel
successores suos inde particulatim ante hec tempora provisum fuisset, tunc de
dictis centurn marcis annuis tautum decidat quantum eidem Rogero vel
heredibus suia peripsum proavum nostrum vel heredes suos, aut per Domi-
num Ricardum. nuper Regem Anglie secundum post conquestum, provisum
existat, aut prefato Thome vel dictis heredibus suis per nos vel heredes nos-
tros provisum fuerit in flaturum. Iu cujus rei testimonium bus litteras

die Maii anno regni nostri primo. Per breve de privato sigillo et pro xl·
solidis solutis in hanaperio.”

Notwithstanding the good will evinced by this confirmation on the pert
of the new sovereign towards Thomas Lord Bardolf, he subsequently
embraced the cause of the opponente of his government, being thereto
induoed through his friendship for Henry Earl of Northumberland, who

was joined with himself as supervisor of his mother's will. The following

aclrnowledge the receipt of the King's lettera, dated at worcester, 8111 day

in motuterrae death of Agnes Lady Bardolf, Sir Willinm Bardoll‚ knight, her second
son, lord of thia maner, presented John Dowes. North Rungton, a parish in Freebridge
hundred, has its churcb dedicated to All Saints, to which Agnes Lady Bardolf presented
Thomas ltlaystsr iu 1402, thus furnishing evidence of the danesse of Sir Thomas lllortimer,
