. ing these coheirs; one dated at westminster, leth January, 1262, granting

to William la Zucbe, his heirs and assigna, the marriage of the beirs of
Isabellu‚ who had been the wife oi Reginald de Mohun, ior· a fine of 200

marks, and tbe other at Menon, 16th of December, 1261, to the cherillus
Surrcy, informing him that though the King had assigned to Matilda de
Kyme reasonable dnwer of the lands of Willism de Fortibus, his tenant in

to usuain tbe aforesaid Matilda by her lands and chattels in his bailiwick,
of which be was to account at the Exchequer‚ to the surrender of the said

next following. On the Roll of the soth Henry ΙΙΙ. is this entry :—“ Rex
Batonibus suis de Scaccario salutern. Sciatis quod in recompensacionem
cujusdam equi quam dilectus et fidelis noster Hugo de Mortuo Mari nuper

et Agathe uxori ejus uni heredum Comitum Marescallorum quadraginta
marcas, in quibus iidem Hugo et Agatha nobis tenentur ad Scacoarium

Robert Aguilun was an equally devoted loyalist as his brother-indam
Hugh de Mortimer, and on tbe Patent Roll of the rath year of Henry ΙΙΙ.
when the battle of Lewes had ended in the capture of the Snvereign by tbe
rebel Simon de Montfort Earl of Leicester, are inserted under the heading
“ De securitate recipiendas Roberto Aguilun, inimico Simonis de Monte-
forti‚'' four Letters with the King’s teste at Nortbampton, lltb day of
April, 1265, severally addressed to Thomas Fitz Thomas, Mayor of Lon·
don, Robert Aguilon, and Master Thomas de Piweleden, from which we
learn that he had deferred taking the oath, which had been required by the

rebels of those who were suspected of adherence to their opponente.
