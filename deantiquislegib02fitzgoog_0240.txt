the wife of Sir Bryon stapleton, had died previous to its date. ‘⁴ Item,
eodem die (xiiidie Januarii, anno Domini mcccc octogesimo quarto) littera

Alicio relicte Willelmi Nevill nuper de Cotborp militis defuncti, ad solemp-
nisacionem faciendam matrimonii inter se per quencumque capellanum
idoneum in capella sive oratorio intra manerium de Carleton predictum
eiurato, bannis unica vice prius editis inter eosdem in ecclesiis suis parocbia·

1509, it would seem that his mother had died soon aster his birth, in tbe
preceding year. Owing to the special act of attainder above recited, no
portion of tho inhentance of the illustrious families oi Lovell aud lienu-

family, descended to tbe beirs. But in tho proceedings which took place in
the claim sor the boucoy, evidence was adduced in proof of the coheirsbip
of this title being vested iu the familias of stapleton aud Bertic ; and thereby
we acquire the certain knowledge that Miles-Thomas now Lord Beaumont
and Montagu now Earl oi Abingdon aro, at tbs time of this publication,
the lineal descendants and heire of the body cf Heury FitaAylwin, lirst
