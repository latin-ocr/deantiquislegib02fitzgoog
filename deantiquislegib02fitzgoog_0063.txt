On the Chsrter Roll 1 John, leno, there is a oopy 010 obnrtsr 01 King
John dated at Porohester, neth day 01 April, in the first year 01 his reign,
moiting aeonvsution made between Willinm de Vernon, Eari 01 Dsron, and
Hubert de Burgh, the King's chamberlain, in regard 01 the marriage ot'
Joanna, younger daughter 01 the said earl, whom the said earl had giren ιο
be a wito to the aforesaid Hubert at the request and with the goodwill snd
assent 01 the King. By it the eorl assigned ιο his oldest born daughterths
eaput olbis honour in Devonshire, with the Castle 01 Piympton, se bers by
right 01 primogenitura, and with a mmonablo portion belonging ιο her οι·
his inheritanoe3 nnd tn Joannn, his younger daughter, tha entire leland 01
Wight, and Christohuroh oom. hiante, with a reasonable portion belonging
ιο her 01 his inheritanoe. 'l'hen follows this sariug clausae “Idem vero
onmes feeit memorosum Hubertum capere homagium baronum st militum
suorum de Insula salva fidelitate Domini Regis et ipsius Comitis; solva
etiam fidelitate heredis masculini forte heredem memmium hebuerit de
uxore sun; salvo etiam dominio et saisina ipsius Comitis in vita sua de om·
nibus terris et turdis suis. Si voro eontingat ipsum comitem heredem mas·

heir will hnve been subsequent ιο this datoribus proring that the marriage
with Margaret lltngerald subsisted up to the year 1216, as otherwise the
age 01 puberty would not have been reached by the husband. The register
01 the Abbey 01 Ford oorreotly fines the time 01 his deoease on the tirst day 01
September, 1216, leaving an only son,Baldwin; so that in this spaoo 01 one
mouth end nineteen days, between the lst 01 September ond leth 01 Ootober,
his widone, Margaret, had been compelled by the ruthless tyrsnt ιο marry his
isvourite against her will, in her weeds, and without her father's consent.
