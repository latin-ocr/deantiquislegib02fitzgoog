PREFACE. CXV

The public services of John Lcrd Bardolf are detailed by Dugdale in his
Baronnge, who, aller noticing that he was on the King’s service beyond
sea in 37 Edw. lll. adda ‘⁸ but this is allthat Ι have seen 01 him till his
death, which hapned 3 Aug. 45 E. lII.'' This observation clearly proves
that the record he cites, Esu. 45 Edw. ΙΙΙ. ιι. 7, had never been perused by
this writer, and isin direct contradiction to his next paragraph, which con-
tains this narrative :-“ To whom succeeded William, his son aud heir, then
xiv years of age, whose wardship and marriage was granted by Queen
Philippa (wife 10 King Edward the Third) in 40 Edw. ΙΙΙ. unto Sir
Michael Poynings, Knight, to the intent that hc should marry Agnes,
daughter of the said Michael (Pat. 40 Edw. 111. p. l, m. 37); which
William, upon proof of his age and doing his homage in 45 Edw. 111. had
livery of his lauds. (Rot. Claus. 45 Edw. 111. ιιι. 14.)” This confusion 01
dates arose from the inquisition post mortem having been calendered as of

October, 37th year of his reign, 1363. Pursuant to this writ an inquisition
was taken at Woodbridge, com. Sur. 1811 day 01 December following, on
which the finding 01 110 jurors was to this effect, that John Bardolf of

manor 01 Ilketshall, in the said county of Suffolh, by what service was
unknown, value xvli. xixa. ind. And they say that the same John died on
the third day of August last past, and that William, his son, is next heir uf

previous date an inquisition was taken at Pyncham, com. Norf. 1411 day
