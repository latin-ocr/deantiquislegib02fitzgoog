- On the seventh day aiter the date cf this codicil, the sixth day cs June,
l9th Hen. vl, the testator died, and Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of
Canterbury, granted probate of this will end codicil, by his letter, becring

date at his monor of Croydon, on the aeth day of the same mouth, being
in the esth year oi* his translation to that see, addreesed to erliam
Gcffchin, in decretis Baccalaurius, appointing him his proetor. Upon the
reeeipt of this letter on the second of July, the proctor repaired to Suffolh,
and administraticn cf the effecta was granted to Joan, Lady Bardclff, Wil-
liam Goode esqure, John Puttoh, and Richard Palmer eleth, the two
others haring renounoed, on the eighth day of J uly, in the church of Den-
nington.

Availing themselves of the proviso in the codicss, the executors did not
comply with the humble request of the testator to be buried in the ceme-
tery nithe church of Dennington, and he yet lies entombed with his wife
under a square oblong monument, ornamented with gothic tracery, on
which are the effigies of both in alabaster, richly painted and gilded, eight
ieet in length end four in breadth, in the chapel of St. Margaret, on the
south side of the church of St. Mary of Dennington. A drawing atter the
tomb was made by Joshue Kirby, end published by him March 25, 1748,
haring been engraved by J. Wood; which plate is inscribed to Sir John
Rouse, Beronet. subsequently dnwings of the same effigies were made
by C. A. Stothard, one of which was etched by him, and the other by
C. J. Smith, and now constitute the plates 110 and lll in the Monumental
Effigies of Great Britain, folio, London, 1817, where they are erroneously
supposed to be those ot' Sir Robert Grushill and his lady, in Hoveringham
choreb, Notts, as is observed in the accompanying description, and which
error hes been rectified hythe pnblishers in a communication inserted in
the Gentleman’s Megarice. The first of these platea ia a front view oi
both effigies, and the second a profile view ot‘ Lord Bardolf, with details
representing one extremity of the collar of S.S.‚ and the centre of the

girdle, and the letters 1.H.s. on the bacinet. Lord Bardolf is represented
in full armour, sare the visor, his head resting on his helmet with

leth Han. Vl„ 1441, the year ol the decenae ol the testator. And hence the discrepancy
in deacribing John Lord Beaumont aa a viscount before his oreatlon to the title, il the
'codieil had been dated eth July, 1439, aa lt stands printed in his Bnmnage, rol. ii.
